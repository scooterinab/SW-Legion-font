SW Legion Icons font

A font of the various icons used by the tabletop miniature game Star Wars Legion, by Atomic Mass Games.

This is an updated version of the font (created by Appleton, and updated by lyerelian and Retinue), adding new icons from the 2025 update to the game.

This version of the font also reorganizes the layout of the font, in hopes of improving mapping and usability. Of note, I have created inverted versions of Upgrade icons. The original designs (as capps/uppercase) are typically seen in throughout the rulebook and in-text. The inverted style of icons (as lowercase) use negative space and include a border, and are typically seen on unit cards. This will hopefully allow players to create scenarios and alternate unit cards that will look closer to what is released by AMG (the icons, anyways). I also added various other icons which were either missing or not in use at the time of the older fonts' creations.

As with previous forks, new icons were created by tracing or recreating to icons seen throughout the rulebook and unit cards. My workflow included Adobe Illustrator and FontForge, which allowed for better accuracy and cleaner lines than FontForge alone seems to allow.

Version 4.0:
Updated in 2025/2026 to add new icons, including all factions, inverted upgrade icons, and additional icons that have been introduced to the game. Also reorganized to better group icons and improve ease of use.
 -Added faction icons for Republic, Separatists, and all Mercenaries.
 -Added upgrade icons for Squad Leader, Doctrine, and Programming.
 -Added icons for half range and Overrun.
 -Added icon for Range (as seen in the Weapons portion of unit cards, which is different from the existing Beyond Range 5 icon).
 -Added icons for Expend, Expend after action, and Exhaust (with a border).
 -Redrew some icons to improve appearance.
 -Created inverted upgrade icons with outlines (as seen on unit cards, vs the in-text style seen without an outline).
 -Reorganized layout to better group together icons, including inverted (card style) and non-inverted (in-text style) icons as lowercase and caps.
